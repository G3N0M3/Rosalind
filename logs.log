After struggling with 7_10_LCSQ, which is abt the longest common subsequence (lcs), searched for a solution.
As expected, finding an lcs was a common question in computer science
and thus an efficient algorithm was already revised.
Did not really "feel" that studying algorithms were important for my career, until solving LCSQ.

Motivation for solving problems at Rosalind is stronger than before.
Probably because the practice is more relevant than ever.
